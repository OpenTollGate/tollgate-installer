App Name and Tagline: TollGate Installer
Tagline: "Easily install TollGate on your fresh router with just a few clicks using a desktop app"

Problem Statement:
The problem this app aims to solve is the difficulty in installing TollGate on a fresh router, especially for those who are not tech-savvy. The current methods of installing TollGate through command lines or terminals can be challenging and time-consuming for users who are not familiar with these interfaces.

Target Audience:
The target audience for this app is individuals who want to easily install TollGate on their fresh router without any technical knowledge. This could include home users, small business owners, and IT professionals who need a simple way to deploy TollGate on new routers.

Key Features:

1. Electron-based desktop interface: The app provides a user-friendly GUI, accessible as a standalone application on Windows, macOS, and Linux, making it easy for users to install TollGate without technical knowledge.
2. Automated installation process: The app automates the full installation, from downloading required files to configuring the router.
3. Customizable settings: Users can adjust router settings according to their preferences.
4. Real-time updates: The app shows available TollGate OS releases, ensuring users can access the latest software.
5. Easy connectivity: The user can connect to their router's network or plug it in physically before installation.
6. Secure SSH connection: The app establishes SSH connections to routers for installation, ensuring privacy and security.
7. Simple setup: The user is guided through a streamlined setup after installation is complete.
8. Automatic router discovery: The app scans the local network for routers with open SSH ports, eliminating the need for manual IP entry.

Technical Considerations:

1. Cross-platform compatibility: Must work reliably as an Electron app on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
2. Native network access: Utilizes Node.js APIs to scan the local network for devices with open SSH ports.
3. SSH connection: The backend can establish SSH sessions directly using Node.js libraries (e.g., ssh2).
4. File transfer: Capable of uploading the TollGateOS image via scp or sftp using native libraries.
5. Installation scripting: Automates the installation and router configuration over SSH.
6. Real-time updates: Checks for and informs users of new TollGateOS releases.
7. User authentication: Ensures credentials (password for 'root' user) are handled securely and never stored longer than necessary.
8. Native auto-updates: Electron app supports easy self-updating and bugfix deployment.

User Flow:

1. User launches the TollGate Installer desktop app.
2. The app scans the local network for devices with open SSH ports and attempts login as 'root' using the provided password.
3. The app determines the Architecture and Model of the OpenWRT router, and checks if it's compatible.
4. Upon successful connection, the app installs TollGateOS automatically.
5. The app guides the user through the remaining setup after install.
6. The app displays current TollGateOS versions and offers upgrades if available.
7. The user can connect to their router's network or physically plug it in as needed.

Potential Challenges:

1. Platform support: Ensuring proper packaging and installation on all major OSes.
2. Permissions: The app may need elevated network permissions depending on OS or network configuration.
3. Outdated router software: Some routers may not support SSH or may have incompatible firmware.
4. Security concerns: Ensuring security and privacy throughout the install processâ€”credentials, file transfers, update checks.
5. Network scanning limitations: Firewalls or certain network topologies may hinder detection of all target routers.
6. Authentication failures: 'root' login may not work universally; fallback mechanisms or user guidance may be needed.
